Our Bioinformatics team, led by Professor Claude Chelala, is dedicated to advancing translational bioinformatics through high-throughput data analysis, integration with clinical data, and the development of databases and software, with a particular focus on pancreatic and breast cancers.

## **Research Focus**

We specialize in creating analytical pipelines applicable to patient data, studying the transcriptional and mutational landscapes, and understanding the evolutionary dynamics of various cancer types to identify therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers.

## **Key Projects**

- **Tissue Banking Ecosystem**: Leading the IT infrastructure for the Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund Tissue Bank and providing bioinformatics expertise for both this and the Breast Cancer Now Tissue Bank. Our platforms integrate extensive multi-dimensional cancer data to support research and personalized treatment strategies.

- **Artificial Intelligence in Cancer Treatment**: Collaborating on the OPTIMA project to develop AI-driven tools for improving diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. This involves setting up platforms to store, process, and integrate data from various sources, facilitating personalized patient care. citeturn0search4

## **Major Funding**

Our work is supported by significant funding, including:

- **EU Integrative Medicine Initiative**: Optimal treatment for patients with solid tumours in Europe through Artificial Intelligence.

- **Barts Charity**: Precision Medicine - Unlocking the longitudinal Electronic Health Record phenotype from multi-dimensional data.

- **Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund**: Pancreatic Cancer Research Fund Tissue Bank.

- **Breast Cancer Now**: Breast Cancer Now Tissue Bank.

These projects aim to enhance our understanding of cancer biology and improve patient outcomes through innovative bioinformatics approaches.

## **Team Members**

Our team comprises experts in bioinformatics, computational biology, and data science, all committed to translating complex data into actionable insights for cancer research and treatment.
